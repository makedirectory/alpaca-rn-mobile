          Brokerage services are provided by Alpaca Securities LLC ("Alpaca"),
          member FINRA/SIPC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of AlpacaDB, Inc.{'\n\n'}
          Brokerage services are provided to customers who can write automated
          investment code and self direct their own investments.{'\n\n'}
          This is not an offer, solicitation of an offer, or advice to buy or
          sell securities, or open a brokerage account in any jurisdiction where
          Alpaca is not registered (Alpaca is registered only in the United
          States).{'\n\n'}
          The Paper Trading API is offered by AlpacaDB, Inc. and does not
          require real money or permit a user to transact in real securities in
          the market. Providing use of the Paper Trading API is not an offer or
          solicitation to buy or sell securities, securities derivative or
          futures products of any kind, or any type of trading or investment
          advice, recommendation or strategy, given or in any manner endorsed by
          AlpacaDB, Inc. or any AlpacaDB, Inc. affiliate and the information
          made available through the Paper Trading API is not an offer or
          solicitation of any kind in any jurisdiction where AlpacaDB, Inc. or
          any AlpacaDB, Inc. affiliate is not authorized to do business.{'\n\n'}
          Market prices, data and other information available through Alpaca are
          not warranted as to completeness or accuracy and are subject to change
          without notice. System response and account access times may vary due
          to a variety of factors, including trading volumes, market conditions,
          system performance, and other factors. A more complete description of
          the impact these factors may have can be found in our risks of
          automated trading systems section.{'\n\n'}
          All investments involve risk and the past performance of a security,
          or financial product does not guarantee future results or returns.
          Keep in mind that while diversification may help spread risk it does
          not assure a profit, or protect against loss, in a down market. There
          is always the potential of losing money when you invest in securities,
          or other financial products. Investors should consider their
          investment objectives and risks carefully before investing.{'\n\n'}
          There are risks unique to automated trading algorithms that you should
          know about and plan for. You should setup a method or system of
          continuous monitoring or alerting to let you know if there is a
          mechanical failure, such as connectivity issues, power loss, a
          computer crash, or system quirk. You should also monitor for instances
          where your automated trading system experiences anomalies that could
          result in errant, missing, or duplicated orders. A more complete
          description of these and other risks can be found in our FAQ section.
          {'\n\n'}
          ETFs can entail risks similar to direct stock ownership, including
          market, sector, or industry risks. Some ETFs may involve international
          risk, currency risk, commodity risk, and interest rate risk. Trading
          prices may not reflect the net asset value of the underlying
          securities.{'\n\n'}
          All accounts are opened as margin accounts. Alpaca does not currently
          allow margin loans or short selling, and you will be required to take
          specific steps at the time these features are allowed in your account.
          {'\n\n'}
          You should know that margin trading involves interest charges and
          risks, including the potential to lose more than deposited or the need
          to deposit additional collateral in a falling market. Before using
          margin, customers must determine whether this type of trading strategy
          is right for them given their specific investment objectives,
          experience, risk tolerance, and financial situation. For more
          information please see Alpaca’s Margin Disclosure Statement and Margin
          Agreement. These disclosures contain information on Alpaca’s lending
          policies, interest charges, and the risks associated with margin
          accounts.{'\n\n'}
          Commission Free trading means that there are no commission charges for
          Alpaca self-directed individual cash brokerage accounts that trade
          U.S. listed securities through an API. Relevant SEC and FINRA fees may
          apply.{'\n\n'}© 2019 Alpaca Securities LLC. All rights reserved.
